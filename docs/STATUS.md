# Status

**Where it stands (2026-10-05):** 0.1.0 released (image `ghcr.io/zachcurry13/recipebank:0.1.0` / `:latest`).
0.1.1 released (separate folders), 0.1.2 released (`/config` folder; card photos fit 4096-token home AI models).
Building 0.2.0 on `feature/v0.2` (plan in HANDOFF section 1b).
- Backend: accounts and first-run setup, people with allergies/diets/dislikes/sensitivities/heat,
  recipes (Kitchen and Home & Care), imports from links (JSON-LD, else AI), photos (AI) and pasted
  text (AI, or headings without it), per-person verdicts with strict mode, swaps, label checks,
  Home & Care hazards (mixes, kids, pets, surfaces, storage). Go tests pass.
- Web app: Library, recipe page, cook mode, Add, editor, Family, Admin, Me; checked at 360×760.
- Known limits: some publishers block apps (Allrecipes, Simply Recipes, Serious Eats), so use Paste text;
  the screen stays on in cook mode only over https.

- Install docs done: `docs/TRUENAS.md` (Custom App form and YAML), `docker-compose.yml`, README,
  CHANGELOG 0.1.0, HANDOFF. CI tests pass on `feature/v0.1`.

## Next
- 0.2.0 parts 1-9 (HANDOFF 1b): pantry/supplies, shopping list, meal plan + Tonight, collections + seasons,
  smart search, cook-mode voice, remote access, notifications; then release with the user's OK.
- 0.2: pantry, supply closet, shopping list, meal plan; kitchen tablet only if wanted.
